# simple-js-stacker
Legally distinct block stacker written in JS, with a leaderboard that has data persistence both on device and to a cloud JSON file.

The purpose is to create is simple working block stacker in JS using Phaser, that features some level of leaderboard persistance using both the local device's storage (via the browser, or whatever other application this is running on), and through the cloud via a public JSONBin.

This will be a **game/entertainment** style of approach to a "thick-client" Single-Page Application (SPA).

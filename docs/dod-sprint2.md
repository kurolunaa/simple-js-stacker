# Sprint 2 - Definition of Done
## A. Acceptance Checklist
- Game boots from `index.html`, using plain JS correctly loads all JS files in order; and game successfully starts.
- Core loop: Pieces spawn, fall, can move, and can be stack on each other. When a row is filled out, it should clear the row and move the stack down. When a piece touches the top of the board (like when the board is completely filled up), the game will restart.
- Local-first boot: should read scores from local stroage, if it exists. If local storage scores don't exist, the local storage needs to be populated.
- Implement at least 3 classes, and at least 3 ES Modules
- Evidence: Screenshots/GIFs, project board updates, tag/commit, run instructions updated

# Title
**Simple JS Stacker** *(Games Track)*

## Product
A classic, arcade style block stacking game written in JS using Phaser.

## Problem & User
An install-less easy way to get some quick block stacking action that can be played on anything with a keyboard and a modern web browser. Deceivingly simple gameplay that allows for a high skill ceiling.

## Core Loop
Use the **Left and Right arrow keys** to move the piece left or right on the board. 

Press **Down Arrow** to rotate clockwise, and **Up Arrow** to rotate counter-clockwise.

Press the **Z Key** to "hold" a piece, so that you can use it later.

Press and hold **X Key** to make the piece fall down faster (a softdrop), and press the "Spacebar" to make the piece instantly fall to the bottom of the board.

Your goal is to fill out an entire row (or multiple rows simultaneously) to get a higher score, all without touching the very top of the board!
